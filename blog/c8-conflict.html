      Once upon a time, there was a happy and bright girl who love to sing and dedicated a good amount of her time to choirs. This girl had been in choirs at school since she was in third grade. As she grew older, she became more and more invested. When she started ninth grade she immediately joined her high school A Cappella Choir. At the end of the year, she eagerly auditioned for the more select Madrigal Singers. For the remainder of her high school career she devoted herself to both of these choirs. She earned solos and leadership positions, and she took on additional responsibility. By her senior year, she was appointed co-manager of both groups with one of her best friends.

      Being a co-manager was her dream. It was one of two positions appointed by the director. These two people were in charge of the choirs. They're responsible for organizing events and coordinating with venues. The members of the choir report to the manager if they have an issue. What this girl looked forward to the most was planning the end of the year banquet. This banquet celebrates having a great year and is a bit of a send off to the seniors who are leaving. It's a very sentimental event.

      When the time came, the director told the co-managers to organize the banquet. Immediately, the two of them got together and planned with excitement. They were determined to make this the best banquet of the four years they'd been there. They divided and conquered. The girl coordinated the food and the guy went and secured the venue. She hired a taco-man to come and make tacos at the event and he booked the same building that had been used in the previous years. They were, as they would say, 'so stoked.'

      However, when they told the director what they had planned, he was quite the opposite. He didn't like the girl's plan for a taco man. He thought that having someone making finger food on a griddle wasn't special or nice enough for the banquet. Because of this, he turned to bullying to get his way. Whenever the girl would talk to the director, he would "humph", roll his eyes, and be visibly irritated as she spoke. He made the members of Madrigals vote on whether or not the would like to have tacos to try and overrule the plan. He tried to shame the girl on facebook. I couldn't tell you exactly what he said, but he made it known publicly that he did not support her decision making. The combination of actions infuriated her.

      The girl was livid. Implying that he didn't trust the girl and the guy to do their job (which he appointed them to do) was not only hurtful, but it was also an inappropriate way for him to try and influence the situation. She was incredibly bothered by him being out of line and publicly demeaning her.

      She took action. The girl stood up for herself. She immediately deleted his post and sent him an email expressing her feelings. She was very professional about it and did not let any hint through of how she despised him. She told the director that she did not appreciate what he did. She explained that oftentimes it feels as though he didn't respect her and the guy. The girl ended her email by saying she and the guy were available to talk to him about the banquet and his concerns. They were very open to hearing different ideas. The email was all business. However, when the director responded, he emphasized that the email was "VERY DISRESPECTFUL" and that the girl should "reflect on what you said." This only made her angrier. It was very out of line for him to scold her as though she were a child and not a young adult expresing her feelings respectfully.

      In the end, things turned out okay. I ended up ignoring him calling me disrespectful and trying to get me to favor him because he nominated me for one of the highest awards at my high school, which I should say I won <strong>the</strong> highest award which had no influence by his nomination. I went ahead with the taco man and <strong>loved</strong> it, including our director. It was a very special night indeed. I did end up somewhat losing my attachment to these particular choirs. The director retired and the structure of it all completely changed. All in all this was a fantastic experience to have throughout my high school years. It taught me leadership skills and gave me a hurdle to jump over. I stood up for myself and didn't allow his bullying cripple me. I'm very proud of how I dealt with the conflict.
