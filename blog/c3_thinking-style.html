      There are four generally accepted thinking styles: Concrete Sequential, Concrete Random, Abstract Random, and Abstract Sequential. I took the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">test here</a>, and it turns out that I fall under the Abstract Random group. However, no one person is purely one style or another; each of us have a unique combination of strengths and abilities.

      Reading over the generally associated <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">characteristics</a> of an Abstract Random (AR) thinker has given me insight to who I am as a learner. It lays out different characteristics that I have. They are both those I was aware of and those I would not have realized I possess had I not read them. I found this <a href="http://child-1st.typepad.com/my_weblog/2010/05/the-abstract-random-learning-style.html">link</a> that discusses children and an AR learning style. I felt that it really described me as student and how I responded to different situations.

      Understanding the type of thinking style I have will help me be successful at DBC. I will know what I need to do as a student to learn and will know what trips me up and how to avoid those situations. DBC already has systems in place that are going to help be be successful as an AR learner. These are: frequent feedback, ability to use my creativity, teamwork and collaboration, and freedom from competition. Well, there are more, but a big long list is boring.

      DBC has created a 'feedbackinator'. Having the feedbackinator will really help me be successful. It is something that will help me grow as a student. I find having the constant stream of feedback to be beneficial for two reasons. One, it helps me know whether or not I am on the right track, and two, it gives me insight to what I should keep doing and what I should change. Something that I've sensed about DBC so far is that they are all about teamwork and collaboration. We've been sorted into accountability groups and we have to pair up regularly. It seems that we are expected to be cooperative as opposed to competitive. Both of these systems are really going to be key to my success at DBC.

      So far, the biggest struggle for me has been dealing with time. This probably has to do with my learning type. Those who are AR learners struggle with time limits, strict and inflexible schedules, and having to finish one thing before starting another thing. Within the past two weeks, I've been struggling with keeping the time spent on certain projects down to a minimum and finishing one thing before starting another. What has been ending up happening is I'll spend WAY too much time on certain challenges and then have to rush through other ones to complete everything. This hasn't been detremental to me yet, however I can forsee it bringing forth a lot, a lot of stress to me. In order to prevent this, I'm going to start timeboxing. I'm going to start giving myself a time limit so that I don't run on and on and on with a single problem. I am sure this is going to be challenging for me, but I know that it will be better for my future if I can have a higher productivity rate and if I can get things done within a specific time limit. If I finish with time left, I can always go back and improve my work.

      One of the things I want to keep on my mind as I continue through DBC is the idea of having a growth mindset. I want to have this sort of mindset and apply it to myself and learning. The ideology of a growth mindset is that intelligence can be developed. It's really about keeping an open mindset. The main characteristics of a fixed mindset that I want to embrace are accepting and attacking challenges, persisting in the face of setbacks, and learning from criticism. Being a person with a growth mindset leads to a greater sense of free will. Additionally, I feel that I will be able to reach higher levels of achievement if I am able to overcome more adversity. This will lead to me learning more.
    </p>

      I'm really excited to learn more about myself as a student and to go through this DBC experience.
