      Today, I watched the video "Fireside Chat with Shereef: Kitchen vs. Table."  <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">Here's a link to the video!</a>

        This was a really cool video. It was so interesting Shereef talk about different mindsets and what he looks for and wants people to be. He uses a metaphor of being the consumer at a table in a restaurant and being a member of the kitchen team in the back. In life, consumers at a table often have the mindset of "this is what I ordered" or "this is overcooked" and things along those lines; they have an I'm the customer attitude. However, back in the kitchen, everyone is working on a team, solving problems and creating together with all of their effort. This latter, go get em, attitude is what Shereef wants students to have when walking into DBC. DBC is a tough and challenging, yet cooperative and supportive learning environment. Everybody is in it together and for the long haul. I'm really looking forward to being a part of it. It's only been one week into the program, and everyone is already posting on the Google+ Community and helping each other out. It's so encouraging.

        I would be lying if I said that I wasn't nervous. I have definitely had the thought that I'm underprepared or that everyone in my cohort is more experienced and I'll be behind. However, I 100% know that this isn't the case. Some people will be better than me and some people will be on my level and others know nothing. And, that's okay. Everyone is in it together. Each and every student at DBC will have moments when they get their asses kicked and they'll also have moments when they kick ass. We're expected to take every opportunity to learn and work and I'm looking forward to that.

    My take on the DBC experience is that is a very healthy experience. I am really looking forward to this well rounded outlook. I love that the culture is focused on creating a healthy mind as opposed to someone who just knows things. There's yoga to clear the mind and engineering empathy. The DBC experience is to create smart people who function at a high level and can go out and succeed in challenging situations. I'm so exited to be a part of this.
