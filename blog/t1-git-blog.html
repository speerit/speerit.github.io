      Today is the last day of my first week of Dev Bootcamp, from now on reffered to as DBC. I am going to talk about GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
        GitHub is something that I've used in the past. I've used it to look at code that teammates had written for my robotics club and I've used it to turn in assignments at college. Now, I'm using for DBC. Using GitHub in college was really cool because I was able to be a part of multiple organizations for different projects and classes. It was an opportunity to learn about having different repositories and who can access what and from where and how to work with changes being made in two different locations and what to do to make the master verision correct. GitHub is just a fantastic invention.

        One of the main reasons that people use GitHub is because it helps with version control. Version control is where past versions of code are stored. It's a way to keep track of the changes that have been made. The way it works is that as a developer, you can go back and look at previously saved versions of the code to go over the changes made, if needed. It is a good tool for debugging and reverting to something previously discarded. Git is the local program that helps with version control, whereas GitHub is the online version. The way that git helps with version control is by keeping track of the changes made. Each time you change something, you commit it to git and leave a message with it that says what you did, however vague or in depth you'd like it to be. Each commit is stored by git and those are the versions of the code that you can go back and look at. After you do that, you can push it to GitHub and store it there. That is not the only reason to use GitHub to store code. Another reason is that GitHub also incorporates the idea of social networking. Users can find other people and look at their code and collaborate. It's a great tool for sharing code and for working on open source project or project in a team. It allows people to to work together remotely. Additionally, storing code on GitHub is a backup to just storing your code on locally on your own computer. As long as the code on GitHub is up to date, you can clone your repositories to any other number of computers any number of times and have all of your work. The benefits of GitHub are extraordinary.

      This concludes my first ever blog post for DBC. I'm so excited and am looking forward to continuing on with this!
