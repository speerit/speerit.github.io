Questions are by far the most valuable learning tools. Whether you're in class, you're at a new job, or you're hanging with friends, this is the case. Questions are used to _learn_ about a topic, procedure, person, and so on.

In order to be successful in learning what you'd like, you need to know how to ask the right question. Be specific. For instance, if you want to know how to organize a directory on your computer for a specific project, you need to use the correct terminology. You can't just go and ask your buddy, "Hey, where are we supposed to keep the thingy for this thing?" That _does not_ work. Trust me, I tried that today. Instead, say, "are we supposed to have a separate directory inside our github.io directory for images?" That is _way_ more coherent and will give you the desired outcome you'd like.

Now clearly this is a pretty simple example, but when you're going to learn a complex new topic for school or new task for a job, the same principles apply. Not only will you get the right answer, but it will make the question much easier to answer because whoever you're talking to will know what they are being asked.

Obviously, there are many more things that can determine whether or not the question is a good question. But, the bottom line is if it's clear and specific, then it is a good question.
