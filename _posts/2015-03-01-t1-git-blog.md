This week was focused on HTML an CSS. These are things that are entirely new to me. I knew no HTML and had absolutely no idea how formatting HTML with CSS worked. It was really cool to start to learn about.

I still don't really know how to do that much this way, but I am very excited to learn more. Something that I've sort of been having trouble wrapping my head around is the differences between Margin, Border, and padding, and when to use which. So, this is a post research blog.

It turns out that distinguishing these different elements from each other is simple enough. A margin is the space that seperates a block from the things outside of it. The border is literally a border at the edge of a block. And, padding is used to move contents away from the edges of the block, make the space from the content to the border bigger. The best way to describe the technical difference between padding and margin is that padding is part of the element and margin is not.

This has cleared things up for me!
